# PROJECT

The goal of this project is to create the most realistic possible traffic simulation using Python.

## What I Have Done So Far
- I reversed the driving direction from left to right.
- I decided to use only two traffic lights because the first lane of each road is only for turning right, meaning cars in that lane will never encounter another vehicle.
- The middle lane is for going straight or turning left.
- The third lane is for cars coming from other roads.
- Traffic lights should work in pairs, just as they do now.

## What Needs to Be Done
- There are issues with the paths of cars turning in any direction; they sometimes disappear and reappear in different lanes on different roads.
- There should be no collisions or overlapping of cars. For example, if a car wants to turn left but another car is going straight in front of it, it must yield and then proceed (just like in real life).

Thank you for your help!
